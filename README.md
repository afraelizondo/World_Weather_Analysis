# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of the project 

The current data analysis and visualization was performed for Plan My Trip, a top travel company specialized in the hotel and lodging industry. It helps travelers to choose their possible destinations, anywhere in the world, based on their weather preferences. 

In order to use real data, we made API calls in two websites:
- Open Weather
- Google maps

In each of them we had to read the proper documentation to correctly retrieve the JSON (JavaScript Object Notations) from the cities.  

The final outputs are the maps showing the information from all the vacation spots we think would be the ideal for the customers. These maps can be modified based on two main parameters:
1. Minimum desired temperature
2. Maximum desired temperature

To perform this project, we used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and SciPy Statistics.
